# legend-pygeom-hpges

Python package of Germanium detector geometries for radiation transport
simulations.

legendhpges provides parametrized High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector models
built from LEGEND metadata. It integrates with pyg4ometry/Geant4 for
visualisation and simulation, and offers utilities to compute detector
properties and perform geometric queries.

## Key features

- Build detector geometry directly from human-readable input file format
- Multiple geometries supported: PPC, BEGe, Semiâ€‘Coax, ICPC, plus special variants
- Seamless Geant4 integration via pyg4ometry (visualisation and GDML export)
- Compute volume, mass and surface areas with unit-aware quantities
- Calculation of useful geometrical queries (like distances of points to surfaces etc.)
- Consistent unit handling using pint

## Getting started

legendhpges can be installed from PyPI or conda-forge:

PyPI:

```console
$ pip install legend-pygeom-hpges
```

conda-forge:

```console
$ conda install -c conda-forge legend-pygeom-hpges
```
